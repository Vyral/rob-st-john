    Since 2012, Rob has dedicated his life to the real estate industry. His passion for client service is truly inspiring as Rob has made it his mission to provide such an amazing experience for his clients buying or selling their home that they have the confidence and comfort required to refer him to their friends and family members who are also looking to make a move.

    Rob's reputation with his clients has spread throughout the industry and he now helps other real estate agents, all over the country, by coaching and training them so that they too can provide their clients the same amazing experience.

    Rob continues to build his business as a Top Agent, and his team has been designed to help homeowners maximize their equity when selling their home. With his emphasis on marketing, leadership, and commitment to client service, Rob believes his team has only just begun. His goal is to provide the very best options to consumers who are thinking of selling their home by focusing on three things; selling the home for the highest price; ensuring clients walk away with the most money in their pocket; and providing an experience that is superior to anything else available in the market place.
