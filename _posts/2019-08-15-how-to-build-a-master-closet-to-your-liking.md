Remodeling a master bedroom, adding on a master suite, or building a new home from scratch are all opportunities to **design your ideal master closet.** With these organization and storage ideas, you’ll be able to develop a customized plan of action for installing a great, yet practical, closet.&nbsp;

In terms of measurement, **your walk-in closet should be a minimum of 7x10 feet and preferably 10 square feet for two users.** This will give you ample space to align two or three walls with shelves, cubbyholes, and poles and enough elbow room to reach them without stretching and straining.&nbsp;

For added convenience, **I suggest adding three square feet of floor space to leave room for a chair to take socks and shoes on and off and even fold laundry.** If feasible, keep some space open in the middle for a folding table or a storage island with a countertop—a good spot for packing and unloading your suitcase before and after a trip.&nbsp;

Your storage options will depend on how you prefer to store your clothing. Will you need more space for folded or hanging clothing? Another option is to include a dresser, but dressers can make clothing storage harder than it has to be: As we all know, when you open a dresser drawer, you can only see what’s on top. Trying to pull a shirt out from the bottom of the stack creates more work and will just leave a jumbled mess.&nbsp;

As an alternative (and better) option, **put in a closet-organizing system.** These storage units have an assortment of compartments—each designed for specific pieces of your wardrobe. That includes individual shelves and bins for sweaters and tops; smaller drawers for accessories and smaller articles of clothing; and racks for shoes and hats.&nbsp;

Organizing systems for master closets can range from $800 to above $5,000, depending on whether you buy one “off the shelf” or have it custom built. However you choose to do it, having the right closet set-up in your home will make a world of difference in your day-to-day life, and you’ll enjoy your master bedroom that much more.&nbsp;

Plus, **having a master closet will pay dividends when you go to sell your home.** Quite frankly, one of the biggest concerns buyers have after seeing a home is not having enough storage space.&nbsp;
