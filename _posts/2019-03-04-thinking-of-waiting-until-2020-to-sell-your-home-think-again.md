Many homeowners believe that rising interest rates and the current state of home prices have scared away a lot of potential buyers, but is that really the case?

Fortunately, no. The truth is, **most of the buyers who were unsuccessful buying a home in 2018 are still out in full force today**. Additionally, many more buyers are entering the market every single day. According to a 2018 report by NerdWallet, 32% of all Americans intend to make a home purchase in the next five years.&nbsp;

Inside of that contingent, 49% of all millennials polled included a home purchase as part of their five-year plan. This tells us buyers are still optimistic about the market, and the top five reasons they plan on buying are:

1. They believe it’s a good investment
2. They want or need more space
3. They believe it should be the next step in their life
4. They find homeownership to be more affordable than renting
5. They plan on moving to a new area

This tells me it’s very likely that the buyer who’s looking for your house is driving past it every single day just waiting for that “For Sale” sign to go up, and 2019 is the perfect year to oblige them. Not only do buyers want to buy, but you’ll also face less competition as a seller—Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Mortgage Bankers Association all predict that most sellers will wait until 2020 to list their home.&nbsp;

Don’t wait until next year for a more competitive market. **Stay ahead of the curve and sell your house at the best possible price right now in 2019.**&nbsp;
