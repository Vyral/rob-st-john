Hardwood floors are definitely “in” right now, but the scratches and scrapes they can get aren’t quite so on-trend.&nbsp;

Don’t get me wrong. I understand how easily these little imperfections can happen. If you have pets or children, or even if you don’t, this kind of damage is all but unavoidable. **But with professional floor refinishers charging anywhere from $1 to $4 per square foot, fixing these common cosmetic issues is sometimes easier said than done.** Thankfully, professional help isn’t the only way to get your hardwood floors looking great again.&nbsp;

**Here are four simple, inexpensive ways to get rid of hardwood floor damage on your own:&nbsp;**

**1\. Use stain-matching crayons, pens, or wax sticks.** These cheap, handy tools will easily disguise scratches. Simply rub the crayon, pen, or wax stick over the problem area, and watch as it blends in with the rest of your floor. Many of these products even have stain and urethane to protect your floor’s finish in the future. And, remember, don’t be afraid to mix and match colors to get the perfect shade.&nbsp;

**2\. Use homemade polish.** To easily buff out scratches and add extra shine, combine equal parts olive oil and vinegar, pour a small amount onto the scratch, and let the solution soak for 24 hours. Then, wipe it off and watch the scratch disappear. You may need to repeat this process a few times, depending on how severe the damage is.&nbsp;

**3\. Sand, fill, sand again, stain, and seal the scratch.** Use fine steel wool or lightweight sandpaper to sand with the grain, then fill the scratch with wood filler, which you can level with a putty knife. Finally, sand the area again, stain it, and seal with polyurethane. Using a lambs’ wool applicator will help avoid air bubbles in the finish. &nbsp;Following these extra steps will take a little bit more time, but will effectively repair the scratch instead of just disguising it.

**4\. Use wood putty to fill in gaps.** Using colored wood putty can easily conceal damage to hardwood flooring.&nbsp;
