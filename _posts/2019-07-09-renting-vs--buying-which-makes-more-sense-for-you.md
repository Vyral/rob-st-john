Which is the better option right now: buying or renting?

In a market like ours, where home prices are rising, a lot of would-be homebuyers are choosing to rent instead. There’s a dilemma with this situation too, though: Rent prices are rising. After the crash of 2008, a lot of homeowners lost their homes and became renters. According to iPropertyManagement.com, the number of households renting their home rose from 31.2% in 2006 to nearly 37% in 2016.&nbsp;

Of course, **some choose to rent simply because it’s more convenient for their lifestyle.** Those who have jobs that require frequent moving need the flexibility of a six- or 12-month lease so that they can move on to their next assignment. Also, some believe that it’s cheaper to rent instead of pay for things like maintenance and repairs. Of course, we know that this isn’t true in most cases. Landlords work these and other fees into your rent.&nbsp;

Another reason people choose to rent is that they can’t afford the down payment and closing costs required to buy a house due to their inability to save money after paying their monthly expenses (including rising rent).&nbsp;

**Renting comes with other financial disadvantages, though.** Homeowners can take advantage of tax deductions, and there’s a risk that your rent will go up every time you renew your lease. The median asking rent price has increased steadily since 1988.&nbsp;

Another challenge with renting is that you don’t have a space to call your own. When you rent, you pay your landlord’s mortgage, which makes them the beneficiary of all the equity gained from paying that mortgage.&nbsp;

Now let’s explore the other side of the coin: homeownership. In the past, we’ve mentioned all kinds of financial and nonfinancial benefits of becoming a homeowner, so for now we’ll focus on one major advantage: **being able to lock in your housing costs.&nbsp;**

Assuming you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your costs are predictable. You’ll know exactly what your mortgage payment will be for however long you own your home. The homeownership rate in 2016 was 64%, and it has steadily been rising. Those households locked in their housing costs rather than waiting for their landlord to raise their rent once again.&nbsp;

What are the disadvantages to owning a home? Well, it is a long-term financial commitment, and it’s never easy to just pack up and move if you need to. You also need to save money to buy a home in the first place, which requires careful planning. Additionally, you’re responsible for repair and maintenance expenses.

The bottom line is this: Like everything in life, there are pros and cons to homeownership, so whether it’s the right choice for you depends on your situation.&nbsp;
