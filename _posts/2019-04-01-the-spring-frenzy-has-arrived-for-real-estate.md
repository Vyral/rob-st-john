The spring market is off to the races!

Inventory is increasing, buyers are out in force, and low interest rates are getting buyers and sellers alike off the fence. Research from Realtor.com shows that the first week in April is the best time to list your home for sale. By listing in this first week, **you’ll have 14 times more views, have 5% less competition, and your home will sell six days quicker.**

May and June are also in the running, and the three months combined is often referred to as the spring buying season. There’s a lot of competition in the marketplace, leading to multiple-offer situations on home listings.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of selling your home this year, the time to list is now. According to the National Association of Realtors, 41% of homes sold last month were on the market for less than 30 days. **If you list now, your chances will be even better.**

If you would like to get started on a selling strategy, have any questions, or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
