Today I sat down for an interview with Julia King, owner of King Financial Repair, to discuss some tips and tricks that will help you repair damaged credit and open up future financial opportunities like purchasing a home.

Julia began her career in credit repair 17 years ago, and in that time, she’s helped several thousand people to purchase homes. When you work with King Financial Repair, they’ll look at your credit report, remove any inaccurate information from it, and then send the finished product back over to me so that I can get your mortgage approved and we can begin the home buying process.
