Today I want to talk to you about our favorite four-legged friends: dogs and cats. **Here are nine tips to help you prepare your home for sale and keep it fresh while you have pets living there with you:**

**1\. Steam clean all your fabrics.** This includes your carpets, rugs, upholstered furniture, and drapes. Pets get oils, odors, and fur on the fabric so make sure you get them professionally cleaned before listing.

**2\. Groom your pets.** Make sure they are groomed before you start to list your house. A professional can get more hair and dander off your pet and the gunk is much better off in the groomer’s drain than your own.&nbsp;

**3\. Have your tile grout cleaned.** Tile resists pet stains, but the grout between them sucks dirt in like a sponge. If your grout is really cruddy, i can connect you to a professional who can help you out.

**4\. Get an air purifier.** Your heating and air system has been circulating all of your pet dander and hair again and again. By adding an air purifier, you can pull that hair and dander out of the air before it reaches your system.

**5\. Use enzymatic cleaners.** These are special cleaners made with bacteria that actually eat stains and odors. Make sure you’re using the right cleaner for the stain you’re trying to fix, though.

**6\. Get rid of scratch marks.** Pet toenails leave very telltale marks on your doors and walls. For synthetic walls and doors, you can just paint over them. For wooden doors, take a wood-filler pen and fill in the scratches. For hardwood floors, use steel wool or sandpaper followed with wood filler and polyurethane. For major damage, reconditioning hardwood is always a good investment.

**7\. Use charcoal to remove moisture and odors.** You can get little inconspicuous bags of charcoal that you can hang in places or place some charcoal briquettes around the house. Just make sure that you don’t get the ones that are pre-soaked in lighter fluid.

**8\. Spot clean your furniture every single day.** Trying to keep your pets off the couch completely might be harder to do than say. Instead, just cover your furniture with a throw or pet cover and wash them at least once a week. Vacuum the carpet and rugs when possible, too. For quick hair removal, take a rubber glove and wipe down your couch.

**9\. Perform a sniff test.** After you’ve scrubbed everything and you’re convinced there is no smell, I encourage you to get a second opinion because you may have gone a little noseblind.&nbsp;

I hope you find these tips helpful and you’re able to use them to keep your house clean and fresh with your pets. If you have any questions for me about this or any other topic, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
