Spring has sprung\! As such, today I’ll give you four reasons why purchasing a home in this seasonal market will work more to your advantage than sitting it out.&nbsp;

Let’s jump right in:&nbsp;

**1\. Home prices will increase**. The latest numbers from CoreLogic signal that there’s been a 4.4% uptick in home prices over the last year. In that same report, CoreLogic forecasts that appreciation rates will hit 4.6% over the next year. Home values will assuredly increase from one year to the next, so there’s not much sense in waiting any longer. &nbsp;

**2\. Mortgage interest rates are projected to increase.** Freddie Mac’s primary mortgage market survey tells us that, for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, rates are currently situated at 4.41%. The prevailing wisdom among experts is that rates will increase by this time next year. For those eyeing an opportunity to buy, know that a bump in interest rates will impact your monthly mortgage payment. Why wait?&nbsp;

**3\. Either way, you’ll be paying a mortgage.** Understandably, some potential first-time buyers are uncomfortable with the thought of taking on a mortgage. Yet, unless you’re living rent-free with your parents or the like, you’re paying someone’s mortgage—would you rather it be yours or your landlord’s? As a homeowner, your mortgage is a form of forced savings, which means you’re growing equity that you can tap into later in life. As a renter, it’s your landlord who’s establishing equity through your payments.&nbsp;

**4\. It’s time to move on with your life.** The cost of a home is delineated into two major components: the home’s price and the current mortgage rate, both of which are on the rise. Perhaps you’d like greater security for your family or to be in control of the renovations on your living space. Whatever the reason, your best opportunity could be now. &nbsp;

<br>The bottom line is if purchasing a home in 2019 is a top priority for you and your family, doing so sooner rather than later might mean you avoid increased home prices and interest rates.
