This week, I was asked an interesting question: “Rob, if I’m considering the sale of my home in the next couple of years, what updates or renovations should I consider to make sure I’m spending my money wisely?”

That got me thinking, and so after some digging, today I have a list of the top four home improvements that will yield the highest return on your investment:

1. **Replace your entry door.** On average, this simple upgrade will cost around $1,700, but you’ll yield an average return of 108%\! It’s crazy to think about, but your front door could actually be a profitable upgrade when it comes to selling your home.
2. **Add stone veneer to your home.** Consider replacing some vinyl siding in the entryway with a nice bit of stone veneer—this will boost your curb appeal. This sort of update will cost around $8,900, but you can expect a return of around 94.9%. First impressions and curb appeal make a huge difference in the sale of your home.
3. **Replace your garage door.** This will be a huge boost to your curb appeal, especially to those properties with front-facing garages. The cost of this update circles the $3,500-mark, but typically brings a 92% return on your investment.
4. **Remodel and upgrade your bathroom.** I’m talking about replacing the fixtures, updating the tub, and adding things like 4x4 tile surround. Also, think about adding new, single-lever, temperature-controlled shower controls—a nice feature. A standard white toilet and a solid surface vanity with an integrated sink and recessing cabinet will go a long way. In our area, these improvements rounded out at about $19,000, but you can get a 92% return on your investment.

All of the above figures are based on the **2019 Remodeling Magazine Cost vs. Value Report**, all narrowed down to our market area. They analyzed 36 projects and compiled this report for us so that we could figure out what renovations make the most sense to spend your money on it.&nbsp;
