There are three reasons why getting a pre-listing inspection is a good idea:

**1\. It gives you time to fix potential deal-breakers.** At the end of the day, any major issues will be discovered. If they’re found later on in a transaction, the buyer may simply choose to walk away instead of dealing with them. If you get a pre-listing inspection, you’ll know what repairs you need to make and be able to do them more affordably.

**2\. It prevents big surprises and helps marketing.** When you get an inspection done before you market your home, you’ll be able to be upfront with buyers. You can give them the inspection or fill out a detailed seller disclosure. This gives buyers peace of mind and makes them feel much more comfortable moving forward.

**3\. It can speed up the negotiation process.** Having a disclosure out there and having major issues already addressed will shorten up the timeline of your sale. 

Any issues you find in your pre-listing inspection do require disclosure, even if you fix them. **There’s also no guarantee that the buyer’s inspection will bring up the same issues as yours. **

We have a pre-listing checklist that you can use as a starting point for finding out your home’s condition. If you would like the checklist, want recommendations for an inspector, or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
